	<h1>Instagram Brunch Stock Library</h1>
	<p id="slogan">We brunch so you don't have to!</p>
	<p>Our professional team of brunchers in multiple cities check out the trendiest spots, take fabulous photos of the food, and then you can download them to use on your social accounts.</p>
	<p>Perfect for when you want to 'gram that brunch lifestyle, but can't eat any more eggs or stomach another smoothie bowl!</p>
	<p>Our team will free up your time for taking yoga selfies, redesigning your apartment or making more weird green smoothies that you pretend actually taste good.</p>
	<p>Pay per photo, or purchase a package deal (10 brunches a month, 15 brunches a month, or the Daily Brunch shot). We also run classes and workshops and can support you to take fabulous brunch shots if you prefer to DIY.</p>
	<h2>Our services:</h2>
	<li>Full service photography packages - we eat and snap so that you gain followers without all that annoying downtime in cafes.</li>
	<li>Beat the queue - exclusive access to new brunch spots.</li>
	<li>Equipment hire - if you are still in love with the brunch lifestyle and want to shoot your own bowls, we can set you up with portable flashes and other equipment to make your meal look its best.</li>
	<li>Pet hire - want a cafe dog shot but live in a pet-free apartment? We have the answer.</li>
	<li>Nonchalent hipster background models - if your local cafe is a little too daggy for Insta, our professional models will bring the right vibe.</li>
	<li>Workshops and training sessions - held regularly in major brunch cities to improve your skills.</li>
	<li>Community of practice - with our online peer support network for professional brunchers, you will never really brunch alone again.</li>
